Contains the 'Ellipse_fitter' class. This class can fit a 2D elliptical ring to a 2D intensity distribution. 
The code builds on the curve_fit function from scipy.optimize, and was originally intended for the analysis of astrophysical data.
However, there might be other applications for this code.
If you are interested in using this code and would like an example script on how to use the code, feel free to contact me.
